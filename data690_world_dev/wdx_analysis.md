# Better Education !=  Better Employment

#### What is it that you are investigating/exploring/analyzing (provide sufficient background information)?
Sometimes a greater education may not result in a better job. There are several stages of education. Primary is the starting point, followed by secondary, and so on. The majority of children who start in primary school drop out before they reach secondary school. One of the foundational elements of growth is education. In my study, I'll be analyzing schooling statistics from various nations.

The following are the names of the nations:
- India
- China
- New Zealand
- Australia
- Bangladesh
- United States

#### Why is it important to you and/or to others?
As a citizen of one of the developing countries confronted by the aforementioned issues I believe it is crucial that we identify the primary cause of education abandonment in between. Problems are presented differently to each gender. If the cause can be identified and addressed, the entire system may be affected. Greater education could result in more employment. More development might result from more jobs. 

#### What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer?
Some of the questions that I have are as follows:
- What is the male-to-female ratio in primary and secondary education?
- How many of them continue on to secondary school?
- What is the employment ratio for these two genders?
- Is there a link between education and employment?
- Is there a link between employment and a country's development?

#### Where do you get the data and charts to help answer your questions (give references/credits)?  
Data may be obtained from official websites of countries. Data may be gathered from websites without download functionality using a Web scraper. You can utilize information from the World Development Explorer. Websites like Kaggle, Google Datasets, Amazon Datasets, and others have historical data available.


#### What process/step you use to analyze the situation/issue?
Project steps include:
- Gather information from a variety of sources.
- Analyze the facts in light of the provided hypothesis.
- Prove if the hypothesis is correct or incorrect.
- Comparing statistics between genders
- Compare statistics from different nations.
- Determine the connection between the data's characteristics (Primary Education, Secondary Education, Employment Ratio, Development Related Data)
- Determine how each characteristic impacts the others.
